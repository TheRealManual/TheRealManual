Hey! My name is Nicholas Korcynski, I'm currently graduating with my Bachelors in Computer Science at Rowan University in the Spring of 2026. I'm also a incoming Software Engineering 1 at The Home Depot, starting right after graduation. 

My current position focuses mainly on the frontend part of the Major Appliances section of HomeDepot.com but I'm very interested and focused on expanding my career in Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence.

Here on my GitHub you will find various projects that range from fun programs to use with friends, or production ready applications that make my day a little easier using ML or AI.
